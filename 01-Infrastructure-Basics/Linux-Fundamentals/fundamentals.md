## What is Linux?

Linux is an **open-source** operating system kernel that manages the communication between software and hardware on a computer. The kernel is the core component of the operating system that interacts directly with the hardware.

While the kernel itself is just a small part of the operating system, most users refer to the **complete Linux distribution** as "Linux," which includes the kernel and other essential tools. These distributions can vary greatly depending on the needs of the user (servers, desktops, or specialized environments like security or multimedia).

### Why Use Linux?
- **Security**: Linux is known for its solid security features, including file permissions and user roles.
- **Performance**: Linux is a lightweight operating system that can be customized for performance optimization.
- **Flexibility**: You can modify almost every part of the system, from the kernel to the user interface.
- **Cost-effective**: Linux is free to use, distribute, and modify.
- **Stability**: Linux is reliable and suitable for long-running processes, like servers.

## Linux Architecture

Linux follows a modular architecture. Here's how it is structured:

### 1. **Kernel**
   - The core of the system, responsible for managing hardware and system resources.
   - Interacts with hardware directly and provides essential services to other software.
   - Handles memory management, process scheduling, file systems, and device drivers.

### 2. **Shell**
   - The command-line interface that allows users to communicate with the system.
   - Common shells include **Bash** (default on Ubuntu), **Zsh**, and **Fish**.

### 3. **System Libraries**
   - Libraries are collections of code that applications use to perform various tasks.
   - The **GNU C Library (glibc)** is an essential library that most Linux applications use.

### 4. **System Utilities**
   - These are tools that manage various aspects of the system, such as file management, networking, and processes.
   - Examples: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `ping`, `ps`, etc.

### 5. **User Space**
   - The user space contains everything that runs outside of the kernel: applications, user interfaces, and software libraries.
   - Examples: Text editors, browsers, and other user applications.

## Linux File System Structure

Linux has a hierarchical file system structure, which is organized in a tree-like format starting from the **root directory (/)**. Below are some of the key directories you'll encounter in a typical Linux system:

- **`/` (Root Directory)**: The top-level directory of the file system.
- **`/bin`**: Essential binaries for system booting and operation (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).
- **`/etc`**: Configuration files for the system (e.g., `/etc/fstab`, `/etc/hostname`).
- **`/home`**: User home directories where personal files are stored (e.g., `/home/user`).
- **`/usr`**: Software packages and shared libraries.
- **`/var`**: Variable files such as logs, databases, and spool files.
- **`/tmp`**: Temporary files created by programs.
- **`/dev`**: Device files representing hardware and virtual devices.
- **`/lib`**: Essential libraries required by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

## Package Management in Linux

### What is Package Management?

Package management is a way to automate the installation, upgrading, configuration, and removal of software packages. Each Linux distribution has its own package management system, and Ubuntu uses **APT (Advanced Package Tool)**.

### Package Management Commands in Ubuntu:
- **Install a Package**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install <package-name>
  ```
- **Update Package Index**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```
- **Upgrade Installed Packages**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```
- **Remove a Package**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove <package-name>
  ```
- **Search for a Package**:
  ```bash
  apt search <package-name>
  ```

#### Example: Installing Apache Web Server
```bash
sudo apt install apache2
```

This command installs the Apache web server, which can be used to host websites.

## Common Linux Commands

Linux commands are essential for navigating and managing your system. Here are some common commands, with examples:

### Navigation Commands:
- **`pwd`**: Print the current working directory.
- **`ls`**: List the contents of a directory.
- **`cd <directory>`**: Change the current directory.
- **`cd ~`**: Navigate to the home directory.

### File Operations:
- **`cp <source> <destination>`**: Copy a file or directory.
- **`mv <source> <destination>`**: Move or rename a file or directory.
- **`rm <file>`**: Remove a file.
- **`mkdir <directory>`**: Create a new directory.
- **`rmdir <directory>`**: Remove an empty directory.

### Viewing Files:
- **`cat <file>`**: Display the contents of a file.
- **`less <file>`**: View a file one page at a time.
- **`head <file>`**: Display the first few lines of a file.
- **`tail <file>`**: Display the last few lines of a file.

### Process Management:
- **`ps`**: Show currently running processes.
- **`top`**: Display dynamic process information.
- **`kill <pid>`**: Terminate a process by PID (process ID).

## Permissions and Security

In Linux, security is controlled through file permissions and user roles. Understanding how to manage permissions is crucial to system security.

### File Permissions
Every file and directory in Linux has three types of permissions:
- **Read (r)**: Permission to read the file.
- **Write (w)**: Permission to modify the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute the file as a

 program.

Permissions are assigned to three categories:
- **User (u)**: The owner of the file.
- **Group (g)**: Users who are in the file's group.
- **Others (o)**: All other users.

#### Example: Change Permissions
```bash
chmod 755 <file>
```
