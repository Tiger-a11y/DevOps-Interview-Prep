# Linux Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Linux Fundamentals** section! This folder provides a comprehensive guide to mastering the core Linux skills necessary for a successful DevOps career. Linux is the foundation of many DevOps tools, cloud platforms, and automation processes, and having a strong grasp of Linux is critical for every DevOps engineer.

In this section, we will explore a variety of Linux topics, ranging from basic commands and file management to system monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. You will also gain practical experience through hands-on projects designed to deepen your understanding of real-world Linux administration.

## Why Linux Fundamentals Matter for DevOps

As a DevOps engineer, you'll frequently work with Linux servers in both on-premises and cloud environments. Linux is a powerful, flexible, and stable operating system that is widely used in data centers, cloud infrastructures, and containerized environments. Understanding how to efficiently navigate and manage Linux systems will enable you to automate tasks, troubleshoot issues, and ensure the stability and security of your infrastructure.

## Key Topics Covered

This section is divided into several sub-topics, each designed to provide you with essential Linux skills that are directly applicable to DevOps practices:

1. **Basic Linux Commands**
   - Learn the most essential Linux commands for navigation, file management, system monitoring, and more.
   - Commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `chmod`, `ps`, and `top`.

2. **File Permissions and Ownership**
   - Master the concept of file permissions and how to manage them.
   - Learn how to change file permissions using `chmod`, and modify ownership with `chown` and `chgrp`.

3. **Networking**
   - Understand basic networking concepts, configuring network interfaces, and troubleshooting network issues in Linux.
   - Commands like `ifconfig`, `ping`, `netstat`, and `curl` will be explored.

4. **System Troubleshooting**
   - Troubleshoot system performance, file system errors, and network issues using tools like `dmesg`, `journalctl`, and `strace`.
   - Learn common Linux troubleshooting steps and techniques for diagnosing issues effectively.

5. **Linux Kernel and Process Management**
   - Learn how the Linux kernel works and how to manage system processes.
   - Understand process scheduling, memory management, and kernel configuration.

6. **Performance Tuning**
   - Discover how to optimize the performance of Linux systems for handling high loads.
   - Learn how to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network performance using tools like `top`, `htop`, and `iostat`.

## Hands-On Projects

To enhance your learning and ensure you're ready to apply Linux fundamentals in the real world, we've included several hands-on projects. These projects will help you practice the skills you've learned and gain practical experience working with Linux systems.

### Project 1: **Deploy a Linux Monitoring Stack**
- Objective: Set up a monitoring stack using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to track system performance.
- Learn to install and configure Prometheus to collect metrics from Linux servers.
- Create Grafana dashboards to visualize key system metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.

### Project 2: **Automate User Management with Bash**
- Objective: Create a bash script to automate user creation, deletion, and permission management.
- Gain practical experience writing shell scripts to automate routine tasks in Linux environments.
